The beverage is most commonly associated with Starbucks, which first offered the drink in the fall of 2003. The popular flavor has inspired a wide range of product variations that appear on a seasonal basis.</p>';

    <P>To mix the initial matcha base for the drink, you can use a traditional method including a tea bowl, known as a chawan, and a special bamboo whisk, known as a chasen. Perfecting the balance between water temperature and whisking technique is what separates competence from mastery in preparing matcha.</P>';

A true latte will be made up of one or two shots of espresso, steamed milk and a final, thin layer of frothed milk on top.

It\'ll either be served 1/2 and 1/2 or 1/3 espresso to 2/3 water, depending on the coffee shop in question or how you\'ve chosen to brew it. There is dispute about whether the espresso or the water should be added first, but in the case of the americano, espresso should always be added first as the crema mixes in and creates a more mellow, even taste. But some people may add it depending on their personal preference. Whilst most other espresso-based coffee drinks include milk, such as the cappuccino or latte, the americano stands out amongst them.</p>';

An expertly made cappuccino should be rich, but not acidic and have a mildly sweet flavouring from the milk. And, because the milk is not actually mixed in it gives the espresso a stronger flavour.</p>';

It is blended together in a blender, which gives it a smooth and creamy texture. Additional ingredients such as syrups and whipped cream can also be added to customize the flavor.</p>';
